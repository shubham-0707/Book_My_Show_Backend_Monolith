# Book_My_Show_Backend_Monolith
- In this project I have tried to mimick the backend of the Book My Show Application
- The whole architecture of this application is build in Monolithic way.
- But the real Book My Show Application is build in MicroServices architecture.
- I have made Controllers, Services with their implementation , Repositories and their model classes also.
- The major tech stacks used in project are SpringBoot , JPA Hibernate etc.
- Feel free to use this source code whenever and wherever needed.
